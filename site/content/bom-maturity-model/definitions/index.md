# A Note on Definitions

<p><br></p>

The SCVS BOM Maturity Model attempts to align its terminology with industry accepted norms, software and physical 
supply chain terms, and the English language dictionary. As such, terms used in the SCVS BOM Maturity Model may have
slightly different meanings across different BOM formats. 

The following were referenced in the alignment of definitions:
- [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/)
- [OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/)
- [U.S. Copyright Office](https://copyright.gov/)
- [U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://nist.gov/)
