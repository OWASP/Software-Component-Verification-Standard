# V2: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Requirements

## Control Objective

Automatically creating accurate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the build pipeline is one indicator of mature
development processes. SBOMs should be a machine readable format. 
Each format has different capabilities and use-cases they excel in. Part of SBOM adoption is identifying the use-cases 
and capabilities best suited to specific purposes. While SBOM format standardization across an organization may be 
desirable, it may be necessary to adopt more than one to meet functional, contractual, compliance, or regulatory 
requirements.
