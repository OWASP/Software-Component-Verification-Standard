# V1: Inventory Requirements

## Control Objective

An accurate inventory of all components used in the creation of software is a foundational requirement for further
analysis. The following controls incorporate single application inventories, organizational inventories, and approaches
to enable software transparency when procuring new software or systems.

Component identification varies based on the ecosystem the component is part of. Therefore, for all inventory
purposes, the use of identifiers, such as Package URL, may be used to standardize and normalize naming conventions for
managed dependencies.

An organization-wide inventory of all first-party and third-party (including open source) components allows for greater
transparency within the organization, promotes software standardization and reuse, and allows for rapid impact analysis.
