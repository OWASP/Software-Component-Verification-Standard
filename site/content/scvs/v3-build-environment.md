# V3: Build Environment Requirements

## Control Objective

Software build pipelines may consist of source code repositories, package repositories, continuous integration and
delivery processes, and test procedures, along with the network infrastructure and services that enable these 
capabilities. Every system in the pipeline may provide an entry-point in which flaws, failures, and misconfigurations 
can compromise the software supply chain. Hardening the systems involved and implementing best practices reduces the
likelihood of compromise.

## Verification Requirements
