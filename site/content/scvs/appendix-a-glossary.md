# Appendix A: Glossary

- **Chain of custody** - Auditable documentation of point of origin as well as the method of transfer from point of 
origin to point of destination and the identity of the transfer agent.

- **Component function** - The purpose for which a software component exists. Examples of component functions include 
parsers, database persistence, and authentication providers.

- **Component type** - The general classification of a software components architecture. Examples of component types 
include libraries, frameworks, applications, containers, and operating systems.

- **CycloneDX** - A software bill of materials specification designed to be lightweight and security-focused.

- **Direct dependency** - A software component that is referenced by a program itself.

- **Package manager** - A distribution mechanism that makes software artifacts discoverable by requesters.

- **Package URL (PURL)** - An ecosystem-agnostic specification which standardizes the syntax and location information 
of software components.

- **Pedigree** - Data which describes the lineage and/or process for which software has been created or altered.

- **Point of origin** - The supplier and associated metadata from which a software component has been procured, 
transmitted, or received. Package repositories, release distribution platforms, and version control history
are examples of various points of origin.

- **Procurement** – The process of agreeing to terms and acquiring software or services for later use.

- **Provenance** - The chain of custody and origin of a software component. Provenance incorporates the point of
origin through distribution as well as derivatives in the case of software that has been modified.

- **Software bill of materials (SBOM)** – A complete, formally structured, and machine-readable inventory of all 
software components and associated metadata, used by or delivered with a given piece of software.

- **Software Identification (SWID)** - An ISO standard that formalizes how software is tagged.

- **Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)** - A Linux Foundation project which produces a software bill of materials 
specification and a standardized list of open source licenses.

- **Third-party component** – Any software component not directly created including open source, "source available", 
and commercial or proprietary software.

- **Transitive dependency** - A software component that is indirectly used by a program by means of being a dependency 
of a dependency.
