# Guidance: Open Source Policy

The following points should be viewed as suggestions based on the success and best practices of organizations 
employing them. They are not part of SCVS.

- All organizations that use open source software should have an open source policy
- The open source policy is supported and enforced by cross-functional stakeholders
- The open source policy should address:
  - The age of a component based on its release or published date
  - How many major or minor revisions old are acceptable
  - Guidance for keeping components continuously updated via automation
  - Exclusion criteria for components with known vulnerabilities
  - Mean-time-to-remediate criteria for updating at-risk components
  - Restrictions on using components that are end-of-life or end-of-support
  - Criteria for supplier selection or exclusion
  - Usage-based list of acceptable licenses
  - Prohibited components list
  - Mechanisms and permissions for providing modifications back to the community producing the component
