# V6: Pedigree and Provenance Requirements

## Control Objective

Identify point-of-origin and chain of custody in order to manage system risk if either point-of-origin or 
chain of custody is compromised. For internally maintained repositories it is important to maintain
pedigree and provenance data for imported components.
